# SAS-code

Commonly used SAS code that we can share.

## Requirements

-   SAS version 9 or higher

## How to run

-   Open `config-example.sas` and follow the directions to create your own
    configuration file. Save this file as `config.sas` in the same directory.
-   Run `project_master.sas`. The method used to run it shouldn't matter (e.g.,
    the basic SAS GUI, Enterprise Guide, or batch mode).
-   Look for the output in the directory you specified in `config.sas`.
